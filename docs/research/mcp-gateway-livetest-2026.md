# MCP Gateway — Live End-to-End Test Report

**Date:** 2026-04-24
**Branch:** `feat/gateway-toolkit-338`
**Author:** end-to-end live test conducted in response to "all just code and simple unit tests" pushback on the unverified PR.

---

## TL;DR

End-to-end live test surfaced **three bugs** that all the existing unit and integration tests had passed. Two were fixed inline (audit attribution and OAuth-token-survives-restart) with verifying tests added; two are filed as known issues for follow-up.

After the fixes, the full path — `create connection via admin API → upstream tool discovery → portal-style PKCE OAuth flow → encrypted token persistence → process restart → token reload → proxied tool call → audit row with correct connection attribution → forced token expiry → automatic refresh-token rotation` — works against a real running platform with a real Postgres backend.

---

## Test environment

- `make dev` — Docker Compose with Postgres (acme-dev-postgres) and SeaweedFS
- `mcp-data-platform` binary built from `feat/gateway-toolkit-338` HEAD, run with `dev/platform.yaml`
- **Mock OAuth provider** at `:9180` (`/tmp/livetest/`) — single-file Go program implementing `/authorize` and `/token` (authorization_code, refresh_token, client_credentials) with **10-second access TTL** and refresh-token rotation
- **Mock MCP upstream** at `:9181` — go-sdk MCP server with three tools (`echo`, `add`, `now`) and bearer-auth middleware
- **Real MCP client** (separate `/tmp/livetest/client/`) using `go-sdk` `StreamableClientTransport` against the platform's `/mcp` endpoint with the dev API key

The test was run twice: once to find bugs, once to verify the fixes. The mock servers are deterministic enough to reproduce both runs.

## What was actually verified end-to-end

### Path 1 — bearer-auth proxy (clean)

| Step | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Create connection via `PUT /api/v1/admin/connection-instances/mcp/mockup` with `auth_mode=bearer` | `200` + saved row, `credential` field stored as `enc:...` ciphertext |
| Platform discovers upstream tools | `gateway: upstream connected connection=mockup tools=3` in platform log |
| MCP client sees `mockup__echo`, `mockup__add`, `mockup__now` in `tools/list` | All three appear next to native `trino_*`, `datahub_*`, `s3_*`, `memory_*` |
| Call `mockup__add a=7 b=35` | Returns `42` |
| Call `mockup__echo "hello-from-livetest"` | Returns `echo: hello-from-livetest` |
| Audit row written | `tool_name=mockup__add toolkit_kind=mcp connection=mockup success=t duration_ms=7 parameters={"a":7,"b":35}` |

### Path 2 — OAuth authorization_code + PKCE (full dance)

| Step | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Create OAuth connection with grant `authorization_code` | row saved; `oauth_client_secret` stored as `enc:...` |
| Connection without token → "awaiting reauth" placeholder | platform log: `gateway: oauth authorization_code connection awaiting reauth` |
| `POST /api/v1/admin/gateway/connections/oauthup/oauth-start` | returns `authorization_url` containing `response_type=code`, `code_challenge_method=S256`, valid `state`, `redirect_uri=/api/v1/admin/oauth/callback` |
| Browser-style follow of the auth URL → mock `/authorize` → callback | mock log shows `/authorize → redirect to .../callback?code=auth-code-1`; platform log shows `gateway: upstream connected connection=oauthup tools=3` |
| Token row in DB | `gateway_oauth_tokens` has `access_token=enc:...`, `refresh_token=enc:...`, `expires_at=` (UTC), `scope='api refresh_token'` |
| Call `oauthup__echo` | Returns `echo: hello-from-livetest`; audit row has `connection=oauthup` (after fix #1) |
| Wait > 10s for access TTL to expire, call again | mock OAuth log shows new `/token refresh_token rotated old=ref-N → access=acc-N+1 refresh=ref-N+1`; tool call still succeeds |
| **Restart the platform binary** (kill + relaunch) | startup logs: `awaiting reauth → upstream connected` for `oauthup` within ~37ms; first call after restart succeeds |

## Bugs found

### Bug A (CRITICAL, FIXED) — OAuth tokens didn't survive process restart

**Symptom:** After kill + restart of the platform binary, `oauthup__echo` returned `unknown tool`. The encrypted token was in the DB, but the connection stayed in "awaiting reauth" indefinitely.

**Root cause:** Wiring order in `cmd/mcp-data-platform/main.go`. Platform construction calls `toolkit.AddConnection(...)` for every persisted `mcp` connection BEFORE `wireGatewayTokenStore(p)` runs. So when an authorization_code connection's `addParsedConnection` ran, `t.tokenStore` was `nil`, the OAuth `Token()` had no persisted token to load, the upstream dial failed, and the connection landed as a dead "awaiting reauth" placeholder. `SetTokenStore` simply attached the store for future calls — it never retried existing placeholders.

This entire feature was non-functional across restarts despite all unit + sqlmock tests passing, because no test exercised "AddConnection with no store, then SetTokenStore" in that order.

**Fix:** `pkg/toolkits/gateway/toolkit.go:SetTokenStore` now collects every authorization_code placeholder under the lock, removes them from the connection map, and re-runs `addParsedConnection` for each outside the lock so the new store is consulted. Order-independent now.

**Verification:** `TestSetTokenStore_RetriesAuthorizationCodePlaceholders` (`pkg/toolkits/gateway/oauth_test.go`) — adds a connection without a store (placeholder created), wires a pre-seeded store, asserts tools are now discovered. Plus the live restart-and-call test passes.

### Bug B (HIGH, FIXED) — Audit rows for proxied tools had empty `connection`

**Symptom:** Audit DB rows for `mockup__echo`/`oauthup__echo` had `toolkit_kind=mcp` populated but `connection=''` — making per-upstream auditing impossible despite the data being right there.

**Root cause:** `pkg/registry/registry.go:GetToolkitForTool` always returned `toolkit.Connection()`, which for the gateway is just the toolkit's default name. Per-tool routing to per-upstream is unique to multi-connection toolkits and the registry didn't have a way to ask the toolkit which connection a specific tool belongs to.

**Fix:**
- New optional interface `registry.ConnectionResolver { ConnectionForTool(toolName string) string }`.
- Gateway toolkit implements it by walking its `connections` map and matching tool name → connection.
- Registry uses the resolver when present, falls back to `Connection()` when absent or empty.

**Verification:**
- `TestGetToolkitForTool_MultiConnectionResolverWins` + `TestGetToolkitForTool_FallbackWhenResolverReturnsEmpty` (`pkg/registry/registry_test.go`)
- `TestConnectionForTool_ResolvesPerToolToConnection` (`pkg/toolkits/gateway/toolkit_test.go`)
- Live: `mockup__add` audit row → `connection=mockup`, `oauthup__echo` audit row → `connection=oauthup`.

### Bug C (MEDIUM, NOT FIXED — known issue) — Refresh-token storm on initial connection

**Symptom:** Right after the initial `authorization_code` exchange minted `acc-2/ref-1`, the mock OAuth log showed four extra `refresh_token rotated` calls in the same second, before the gateway had been used for any tool call. The DB stored `acc-6/ref-5` rather than `acc-2/ref-1`.

**Hypothesized cause:** The auth round-tripper is calling `Token()` multiple times during initial discovery (e.g., one HTTP request per `initialize` + `tools/list` + something else), and each call's expiry check is misfiring (likely a small window where `time.Now().After(state.ExpiresAt)` evaluates true on a freshly-issued token, possibly due to the PersistedToken loading path setting an unexpected ExpiresAt).

**Why not fixed now:** Functionally harmless (rotations succeed, refresh-token rotation is normal OAuth practice, eventual state is correct). But it wastes upstream API quota and produces noisy audit-style records on the upstream side. Worth investigating but doesn't block #338.

**Filed as:** P2 follow-up — "investigate refresh-token storm on initial connection".

### Bug D (HIGH, NOT FIXED — known issue) — In-memory PKCE state, multi-replica unsafe

**Symptom:** `pkg/admin/gateway_oauth_handler.go` uses a process-global `globalPKCEStore` for `state → code_verifier` PKCE state. Two platform replicas behind a load balancer will fail every callback whose initial `oauth-start` landed on a different replica.

**Why not fixed now:** Out of scope of this live test. Fix is straightforward — DB-backed `pkce_states` table with TTL — but it's a real new migration + handler refactor, not a code-correction.

**Filed as:** P1 follow-up — "DB-back PKCE state for multi-replica safety". Single-replica deployments are unaffected.

## Findings about the gateway implementation that are NOT bugs

- **Tokens are encrypted at rest correctly.** `gateway_oauth_tokens` rows show `enc:`-prefixed AES-256-GCM ciphertext for `access_token` and `refresh_token` when `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is set; the dev environment provided one and round-trip works.
- **Refresh-on-expiry works.** With a 10s access TTL, a tool call > 10s after the previous one triggers a `refresh_token` grant against the upstream and succeeds.
- **Bearer auth path is correct.** Static-token connections work without any of the OAuth machinery — the auth round-tripper injects the `Authorization: Bearer ...` header on every outbound request.
- **Connection mutation is dynamic.** `PUT` on `/api/v1/admin/connection-instances/mcp/<name>` causes the toolkit to re-discover and re-register tools without a platform restart. Verified live for both `mockup` and `oauthup`.
- **Audit middleware reaches proxied tools.** The audit pipeline that wraps native tool calls also captures proxied calls — every tool call we made appeared in `audit_logs` with correct `tool_name`, `parameters`, `success`, `duration_ms`. After Bug B fix, also `connection`.

## What was NOT live-tested

Honesty section. This live test does NOT prove:

- Behavior against a real Salesforce Hosted MCP. The mock provider is RFC-7636-compliant but Salesforce-specific quirks (cookie-based session attachment, lock-screen popups, IdP-side token revocation, scope-string formatting) are unverified.
- Behavior against any other named vendor MCP. Same caveat.
- Persona/glob filtering of proxied tools. The MCP client used the dev admin API key which has full persona access. A test where a non-admin persona is denied `oauthup__*` would round out the persona path.
- Cross-enrichment rules firing on proxied tool calls. Engine has unit tests; no live rule was authored against `oauthup__*` and exercised.
- Concurrent OAuth flows from multiple admin sessions on a single replica. PKCE state is in-memory but global; behavior is "race-free for one user, unknown for two simultaneous Connect clicks". (The DB-back fix in Bug D resolves this.)

## Recommendation update for #338

Re-running our prior decision: still **ship as-is**, with the bug A and bug B fixes folded into the PR. They were genuine v1 blockers — without them, the `authorization_code`-grant story is a marketing claim, not a working feature.

The two known issues (refresh storm, in-memory PKCE) are filed as **non-blocking** follow-ups. The refresh storm wastes upstream quota but is functionally correct. The in-memory PKCE is a single-replica-only constraint we should disclose in the docs and resolve before any HA deployment.
